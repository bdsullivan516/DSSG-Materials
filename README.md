## Stata: Sample Bootstrap Code
#### I have included a do file that bootstraps standard errors on estimated gender wage gaps, which are calculated using the Heckman two-step method.
#### To run the code you will need Stata 13 or higher. You will need to save the do file and .dta files in the same folder to ensure code runs.
#### You will need the following .dta files:
- c_2000_MR_exact.dta (Sample 2000 Census Data)
- temp.dta
- tempV2.dta
- tempV3.dta
- temp_educ.dta
- temp_marst.dta

## Example of frmttable command
#### create_table_sample.do illustrates how I use the frmttable command in Stata. The do file cannot be executed.
#### I have used frmttable to create the table in table_sample_dssg.pdf

## Example of Graph Editing
#### cps_wage_gap_gph.do illustrates how I modify graphs in Stata. I have not provided the .dta files called by the do file, so the code is not executable.
#### graph_dssg.pdf compares the same graph before and after my edits.
